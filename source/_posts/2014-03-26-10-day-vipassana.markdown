The meditation camp deserves an email on its own.

Things moved so rapidly in those 10 days. All in my head. My mood was changing from hour to hour, depending on my thoughts. There are moments when I would find some thoughts very interesting, and the next hour, I wouldn't be able to understand why I thought so or wouldn't even be able to recall the original thought at all.

Facing myself was definitely tough. When my mind wanders, there were 2 directions it goes: past and future. There were 2 altitudes it goes: positive and negative. Gradually, it was clearer to me what I loathe and what I love.

There were a few major breakthroughs to me (which I made a mental note to remind myself every day in the camp, because I had tons of minor ones that I found myself forgot the next day):

Day 3, I hit the biggest slope on that emotional roller-coaster I had been on since camp. I was extremely happy in the morning because of some future scenario I had in my head. In the afternoon, the same production team put me through so much sadness. Experiencing those extremes was crazy. "OK, this mind is not to be trusted" - thought I in the evening.

Day 5, I had been warier of the mind. Thoughts came and went more easily. End of that day, I realized how I had been letting them go but I still entertained them a lot and had been vested emotions into them. I paid more attention in staying detached to thoughts.

Day 9, I was thinking about relationships with people. And it hit me how I tended to think of those dearest to me in the "mine" context. "They are my X. They love me. They do the awesome Y, they do the bad Z. And I love them". At the same time, I found myself capable of honestly love them in a different/boarder way now. I found it fortunate to have a chance to be close to them, knowing them as a person better than an average pedestrian I passed by every day. I was able to see them as simply human beings, like me, with desire for happiness. And I love them, whether they are mine or not. Now or in the future. Thinking of the past, I took many incidents much less personally.

After a few days, I also found peace more often. I experienced a kind of happiness that I hadn't experienced for a long time. I call it self-sufficiency happiness. I felt I needed very little/nothing to be happy and I would in the future too. That's the best kind of happiness, IMO.

I saw a distinction between mind and self. And body. As well as connections between them.

I didn't go to the camp for this. I thought I would have 10 days to train myself to relax and focus. I thought it was mainly about discipline myself. It did happen (I'm mediating 1 hour a day now and I definitely find it easier to focus). Yet the big part of it was spending time with myself.

I also didn't expect there was a technique. There was a "curriculum" and they did teach it step by step and explain the rationale/"science" behind it (1hr daily before bedtime). I also learn lots about Vipassana Buddism. It's not too religious. Whichever part I found funny, I just left it out.

My ego shrinks a bit. The proof is I went in the camp to better myself, and came out glad that I got to know myself a little better.

Leaving the camp was an experience on its own. I set some time out to write down everything I wanted to. I realized how many things that made sense in the camp, didn't make sense when I was out/trying to put it into words. It's like having an REM dream and waking up finding yourself confused how you could believe in it 5 mins ago. This reminded me how different it can be tuning everything out and be with just myself. I find it important to do every once in awhile.

Do it! You -are not one of those people who- -would- wouldn't find yourself boring. (HOW THE FUCK do you do strikethrough in GMail?)

Experience is personal. I want to hear yours later.

May peace be with you.
